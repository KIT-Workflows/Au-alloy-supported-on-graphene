# Au-alloy-supported-on-graphene
Workflow-driven approach for stability and catalytic modulation in the evolution of single-atom catalysts to Au-alloy clusters supported on graphene, as applied in [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-85891-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-85891-6).

# Colab
* Colab notebook for data visualization [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nlk0nvFGPDAAtO6J8oSc2dNsEmlUh2c0?usp=sharing)



The `converged_structures` folder contains the most stable configurations, converged in the `CONTCAR` file format. It also includes the `INCAR` file used for geometry optimization and the `OUTCAR` file containing only the final energy obtained from self-consistent field (SCF) minimization. Additionally, for evaluating covalent bond contributions through [Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP)](http://www.cohp.de/) analysis, the `lobsterin` input files used are provided.
