The `converged_structures` folder contains the most stable configurations, converged in the `CONTCAR` file format. It also includes the `INCAR` file used for geometry optimization and the `OUTCAR` file containing only the final energy obtained from SCF minimization. Additionally, `lobsterin` input files used for COHP calculations are provided.
